# odin-recipes

This project is a simple a recipe page containing three personal ramen recipes. The images in 
each recipe are AI generated, as I don't have actual pictures of each item.

The project is a practice project in order to solidify my understanding of the basics of HTML. It includes links, pictures with alt text, and simple formatting.

In addition, this project also doubles as practice for using git.
